------------------   Checkpoint 1    -------------------
Bug 1
Where: x86_desc.S - gdt_desc_ptr
What: gdt_desc_ptr definition didn't fix bootlooping
When: gdt initialization
Fix:  Was missing .align4 and .word 0 for padding

Bug 2
Where: idt_functions.c
What:  Multiple exceptions can be raised consecutively
When:  During idt exception tests with div_by_0 and page_fault
Fix:   Add while(1) after print statements to spin

Bug 3
Where: paging_func.S
What:  Paging caused bootlooping
When:  During initialization for paging
Fix:   Needed padding by alignment for paging_table and paging_directory

Bug 4
Where: paging.h
What:  Paging caused bootlooping
When:  During initialization for paging
Fix:   In paging_directory and paging_table struct order of fields matter. Least significant to most significant. And compression. Also created union of 4KB and 4MB structs for paging_directory.

Bug 5
Where:  i8259.c
What:   send_function was not working correctly for the primary. 
When:   Whenever a send_eoi function was called for interrupts on keyboard and rtc.
Fix:    We were calling the wrong masking value to send out to the master port. Used master_mask instead of the calculated MaskTemp value.

Bug 6
Where:  keyboard.c
What:   Unable to get the correct indexing on the characters read in from the keyboard data port.
When:   Whenever a keyboard interrupt happens and keycode value is read.
Fix:    Masked to keep only lower 8 bits of the value to have correct index value. And'ed read value with 0xFF.

Bug 7
Where: rtc.c 
What: Function did not work at all. Handler was never getting called so no test_interrupts().
When: When we initialized our RTC.
Fix: Accidentally didn't swap the inputs for outb and inb from OSDev.

------------------   Checkpoint 2    -------------------
Bug 1
Where: rtc.c 
What: Page faulting due to getting stuck in an infinite while loop.
When: Whenever rtc_read was called.
Fix: The flag I was using to check if an RTC interrupt had occured was declared as a volatile variable and was updated in both rtc_handler and in rtc_read. In order to fix the issue, I just had to disable IRQs for the RTC while updating the variable inside of rtc_rea (Call disable_irq/enable_irq before/after the variable update).

Bug 2
Where: file_system.c/read_data
What: Printing out nothing
When: When testing frame0.txt
Fix: Rewrote read_data using memcpy with 1 byte instead of chunks of bytes at a time.

Bug 3
Where: terminal_driver.c/terminal_read
What: Works for first iteration of read/write but messes up for consecutive ones
When: When testing terminal_read/write
Fix: Missing break statement for the enter condition

Bug 4
Where: keyboard.c/keyboard_input
What:  Capslock issues with keys that aren't letters being the special characters
When:  When capslock is pressed and pressing a value that isn't a letter.
Fix:   Added a special letter scancode to check flag the caps flag.

Bug 5
Where: lib.c/putc
What:  Tab will not add extra spaces if at far right of the screen. 
When:  When tab is pressed at last coloum
Fix:   added special test case in put c for tab at enge of screen to tab correct amount of spaces on scroll.

------------------   Checkpoint 3    -------------------

Bug 1
Where:  lib.c/putc
What:   Backspace into the 391 OSDev in the terminal.
When:   Whenever tab was pressed and delteded, some words would not delete.
Fix:    Changed tab to delete whenever the keyyboard_buffer[keyindex - 1] = TAB. Then made the change to stop backspace if keyIndex < 0. This allowed 391OS> to not be deleted. 

Bug 2
Where:  system_call.c/execute
What:   We were not grabbing the EIP correctly from the 4 bytes buffer.
When:   When calling read_data with inode number, starting at 24 until 27.
Fix:    Tried 3 methods, memcpy, shifting, and casting the buffer. Ultimately bit shifting all 4 bytes in the buffer to the right index and ORing them together to form a 32 bit address. 

Bug 3
Where:  system_call.c/read
What:   In read (but also open, close, and write), we would update the variable cur_pcb using a helper function that was created. However, this helper function was returning the wrong address, so cur_pcb was being updated incorrectly, when in fact it did not need to be updated at all.
When:   Whenever read was called. 
Fix:    Removing all lines that update cur_pcb in read, write, open, and close fixed the issue.      

Bug 4
Where:  file_system_driver.c/directory_read
What:   directory read was not correctly printing all the file names when it was called during the ls process
When:   Whenever ls was called
Fix:    Added a global variable counter that incremented inside directory_read and was reset in directory_open

Bug 5
Where:  system_call.c/execute
What:   Stack was incorrect
When:   When running halt
Fix:    Saving ebp and esp occur after all local variable delcarations, which modify the stack.

------------------   Checkpoint 4    -------------------

Bug 1
Where: file_system.c/read_dentry_by_name
What:  running grep would result in a file open error for verylargetextwithverylongname.tx
When:  When running grep
Fix:   Added a check to limit the length of the stored file name to 32 bytes

Bug 2
Where: system_call.c/sys_execute
What:  after typing in testprintt, no other commands would work 
When:  after typing testprintt
Fix:   cleared the file and argument related parameters in pcb block whenever an invalid file or argument was passed in
